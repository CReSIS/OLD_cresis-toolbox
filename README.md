matlab: Matlab code. This is the main directory with most of the source code.

idl: IDL code. Only includes support for reading data product files

python: Python code. Includes support for reading ECMWF weather model files, tape library raw data retrieval.

vim: Vim code. Only includes setup files for using vimdiff.
