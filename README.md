cresis-toolbox: Matlab code. This is the main directory with all of the source code. This is primarily Matlab code with a few other languages used for certain specific operations that are called from the Matlab code.

idl: IDL code. Only includes support for reading data product files

python: Python code. Only includes support for reading ECMWF weather model files.

vim: Vim code. Only includes setup files for using vimdiff.
