beamWidth.m
  Program for determining the null-to-null beamwidth and fooprint
  of an antenna array above the ice sheet specified by [depth,er].

bubble_shape_reflection.m
bubble_shape_scatter.m
bubbles.m
  TEST/DEMO program for simulating the effects of bubbles in a media.
  Specifically: dielectric changes and volume scattering
