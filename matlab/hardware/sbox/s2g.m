% Scattering to Hybrid-G transformation
% G and S are matrices of size [2,2,F]
% where F is the number of frequencies
% (the number of ports is always 2)
% 
% EPSILON is a limit used in finding correspondent Hybrid-G matrices in the
% vicinity of singularities; by default 1e-12, should be enough for most
% realistic problems; could be increased for a gain in speed
