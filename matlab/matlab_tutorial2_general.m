  % Cell arrays and get_filenames

  % To create an empty string
  filepath = '';
  
  % Create a file path string (Matlab data type char for character):
  if ispc
    % On Windows platform:
    filepath = 'X:\public\data\rds\2009_Greenland_TO\CSARP_standard\20090409_01\';
  else
    % On other platforms:
    filepath = '/cresis/snfs1/dataproducts/public/data/rds/2009_Greenland_TO/CSARP_standard/20090409_01/';
  end

  % Get the current working directory (pwd = print working directory)
  current_path = pwd;
  
  % Since filepath is a variable, we have to use the function form
  % for change directory (cd)
  cd(filepath);

  % Now list the contents of the directory for reference
  ls

  % Now go back to where we started
  cd(current_path);
  
  % Now use get_filenames to return all the properly matching files
  % in a cell array
  
  % Returns filenames matching "Data**.mat"
  filenames_all = get_filenames(filepath,'Data','','.mat');
  
  % Returns filenames satisfying "Data_20090409*.mat"
  %   In other words, the computer time on the radar system was:
  %    Year: 2009
  %    Month: 04
  %    Day: 09
  % UTC time: Universal Time Coordinate
  %   This is THE standard for time across the world. It is equivalent
  % to GMT or Greenwich Mean Time which is the time at the prime
  % meridian or zero deg longitude. GPS time is slightly different
  % than UTC time. Most people don't know this, but there are leap seconds
  % every few years to account for a small slow down in Earth's rotation
  % ... GPS time does NOT account
  % for these. However, the method for accounting for them is
  % fairly straight forward since the difference between GPS and UTC
  % is well documented and leap seconds (an extra second) in the UTC clock
  % so that it lags GPS time are always added at the end of the year.
  % For example, in 2009, GPS time is 15 seconds ahead of UTC.
  filenames_all = get_filenames(filepath,'Data_20090409','','.mat');

  % Get the first entry in filenames_all
  %   By indexing the cell array with {} I am extracting the contents
  %   of that cell array location.
  first_entry = filenames_all{1};
  
  % Create a 1 element cell array which has the first entry
  %   By indexing the cell array with () I am using the ordinary
  %   matrix indexing method. 
  first_entry_cell = filenames_all(1);
  
  % Useful short cuts:
  %  Instead of:
  last_entry = filenames_all{numel(filenames_all)};
  %  Use "end" to replace number of elements function numel():
  last_entry = filenames_all{end};

  % Create a cell array containing just the first three elements:
  entry1to3 = filenames_all(1:3);
  
  % Another trick which extracts the first three elements in the cell array
  [entry1 entry2 entry3] = filenames_all{1:3};
  
  % Search through each file name and pull out the frame indices in
  % the data filename. This is the last 3 digits of the filename.
  %   idx is short for index
  frms = [];
  for idx = 1:numel(filenames_all)
    % Useful Matlab command for getting just the file name without the
    % path to the file
    [path name ext] = fileparts(filenames_all{idx});
    % file_idx = extract last 3 characters from name and convert to double
    frms = [frms str2double(name(end-2:end))];
  end
  % Now create a new cell array with just the filenames associated with
  % frames 5 to frame 7
  %   Note: I have used () and not {}
  filenames_range = filenames_all(frms >= 5 & frms <= 7);
  
  % Just print out some examples by removing the semi-colon at the end of the line:
  filenames_range{1}
  filenames_range{end}

  % Note create a pretend file name:
  filename = sprintf('data.%s080101.0000.raw', ymd_str)

% Plot handle manipulation 
 if lesson == 8
   x = -pi:.1:pi;
   y = sin(x);
   z = cos(x);
   %p is the handle of this plot
   p = plot(x,y);
   
   
   get(p);
   %viwe the various properties of the plot
   
   %using get(handle,...) and set(handle,...) functions to view the plot
   %properties and set a certain plot property, respectively.
   %gca, get current axes properties. It will return a handle of the current axis
   %gcf, get current figure properties. It will return a handle of the current figure.
   %get(0), returns the current values of all user-settable properties.
   %for example, if we want to display the range of the x-axis from -pi to pi with space
   %-pi/2
   %the 'XTick'characteristic inside the axes handle can be set as
   set(gca,'XTick',-pi:pi/2:pi);
   
   %In addition, we also want to label the x-axis as the the setup we defined
   %in the last step, then we can use 'XTickLabel' inside the handle 'p'
   set(gca,'XTickLabel',{'-pi','-pi/2','0','pi/2','pi'})
   %Finally, we can use xlabel() and ylabel() function to set the display name
   %of the x- and y- axis
   xlabel('-\pi \leq \Theta \leq \pi')
   ylabel('sin(\Theta)')
   title('Plot of sin(\Theta)')
   %*more details about various characteristics of axes is availabe on the website
   %http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/axes_props.html
   
   
   %there is another useful feature which is 'Visible' inside of the handle
   %property. 'Visible' has two status which are 'on' and 'off'. when the
   %status is 'off' the plot will not display on the figure, but the handle of
   %this plot is still availabe
   %for example
   set(p,'Visible','off')
   pause; %press anykey in command window will continue the execution
   set(p,'Visible','on')
   
   %the advantage of utilizing 'Visible' is that it can save more time
   %to display the desired plot than using two plot() functions
   %the comparsion is shwon below: (if the finall plot is cos(x) )
   %1. using two plot() finctions
   figure(2)
   start1=tic;
   plot(x,y);
   plot(x,z);
   elapse1=toc(start1)
   
   figure(3)
   start2=tic;
   set(p,'Visible','off');
   plot(x,z);
   elapse2=toc(start2)
 
   
   %Comment: The Figure(2) and Figure(3) have the same display result,
   %however, you could find that the elapse1>elapse2. It's indicate that by
   %applying the 'Visible' property, the execution time is shorter than directly
   %update the plot with two plot() functions. Especially, when the plot is
   %dealing with a large data, the significance of 'Visible' will be overwhelmed
